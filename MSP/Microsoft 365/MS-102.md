In my experience, the Microsoft Learn modules for MS-102 did a great job covering most of the material needed to pass. However, the Microsoft practice exam wasn’t very reflective of the real exam format. I found MeasureUp’s practice tests much closer in style and difficulty - and even noticed a few similar questions appear on the actual test
