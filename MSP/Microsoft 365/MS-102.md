In my experience, the Microsoft Learn modules for MS-102 did a great job covering most of the material needed to pass. However, the Microsoft practice exam wasn’t very reflective of the real exam format. I found MeasureUp’s practice tests much closer in style and difficulty - and even noticed a few similar questions appear on the actual test..

The MS-102 is challenging and can be hard to fully grasp what every feature does if you do not have real world experience with them. However, there are plenty of labs and materials available out there for you to practice on! If you work in IT and your company is a Microsoft Partner or you have a Visual Studio Enterprise license, you qualify for a M365 Dev Sandbox tenant with 20 E5 licenses, user data, and a ton of premium services in Entra.
