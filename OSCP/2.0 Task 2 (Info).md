PWK contains seven learning modalities:
1. Learning Modules
2. Demonstration Module Exercises
3. Application Module Exercises
4. Capstone Module Labs
5. The Assembling the Pieces Module
6. Challenge Labs (type one)
7. Challenge Labs (type two)
8. Challenge Labs (type three)

### 2.2.6. Assembling the Pieces

There are 22 Modules in PWK (aside from this introduction and the final module) and for each of them the learner will go through the process of:

1. Reading and watching the Module and preferably following along
2. Completing the Demonstration exercises by copying the input
3. Working through the Application exercises by using specific techniques
4. Attacking machines from start to finish via the Capstone Labs

At this point, learners will be just about ready for the Challenge Labs. The Assembling the Pieces Module represents a bridge between the Modules and the Labs. It provides a full walkthrough of a small penetration test and allows the learner to follow along with all demonstrated steps. In a sense, this Module is the equivalent of a demonstration exercise for the entire set of Challenge Labs.

### 2.2.7. Challenge Labs 0-3

There are three types of Challenge Labs. The first four Challenge Labs are called _scenarios_. Each scenario consists of a set of networked machines and a short background story that puts those machines in context. Your goal is to obtain access to a Domain Administrator account on an Active Directory Domain, and compromise as many machines on the network as possible.

In the same way that Capstone Labs test the learner on the material of multiple Learning Units, these scenarios test the learner on the material of multiple Learning Modules. The uncertainty here is high because you will not know which machines are vulnerable to what types of attacks. In addition, each of the four Challenge Labs progressively increases in complexity due to additional machines, subnetworks, and attack vectors.

Further, you will not know that any _specific_ machine is directly vulnerable in the first place. Some machines will be dependent on information, credentials, or capabilities that will be found on other machines. And some machines may not even be (intentionally) exploitable until after the Domain Controller is compromised.

All machines contain either a **local.txt** file, a **proof.txt** file, or both. The contents of these files are randomized hashes that can be submitted to the OLP to log each compromise. Just like the Module exercise flags; the contents of these files will change on every revert of the machine. We'll discuss more details related to these scenarios in the final Module of PWK.

### 2.2.8. Challenge Labs 4-6

The second type of Challenge Lab consists of an OSCP-like experience. They are each composed of six OSCP machines. The intention of these Challenges is to provide a mock exam experience that closely reflects a similar level of difficulty to that of the actual OSCP exam.

Each challenge contains three machines that are connected via Active Directory and three standalone machines that do not have any dependencies or intranet connections. All the standalone machines have a **local.txt** and a **proof.txt**.

While the Challenge Labs have no point values, on the exam the standalone machines would be worth 20 points each for a total of 60 points. The Active Directory set is worth 40 points altogether, and the entire domain must be compromised to achieve any points for it at all.

All the intended attack vectors for these machines are taught in the PEN-200 Modules or are leveraged in the first four Challenge Labs. However, the specific requirements to trigger the vulnerabilities may differ from the exact scenarios and techniques demonstrated in the course material. You are expected to be able to take the demonstrated exploitation techniques and modify them for the specific environment.

### 2.2.9. Challenge Labs 7-8

The third type of Challenge Labs is like Challenge Labs 0-3. However, the difficulty and complexity of Challenge Labs 7-8 are significantly higher than those of Challenge Labs 0-6. They require skills and techniques beyond what is covered in the PEN-200 material and are intended to help you transition toward more advanced skills, such as those taught in the PEN-300 course. These Challenge Labs are _beyond_ the scope of the OSCP exam.

Also included with your initial purchase of the PWK course is an attempt at the [_OSCP certification exam_](https://help.offsec.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002666252-General-Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQs-) itself. The exam is optional, so it is up to you to decide if you would like to tackle it.

To schedule your OSCP exam, go to your exam scheduling calendar. The link to the calendar is located in the OffSec Learning Portal on the course dashboard, on the top right-hand side. Here you will find your exam expiry date, as well as schedule the exam for your preferred date and time.

Keep in mind that you won't be able to select a start time if the exam labs are full for that time period, so we encourage you to schedule your exam as soon as possible.

We will cover the exam in more detail in the final Learning Module of this course. For additional information, please visit our [_support page_](https://help.offsec.com/).

## 2.3. Summary of PWK Learning Modules

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Obtain a high-level overview of what's covered in each PEN-200 Learning Module

In the previous Learning Units, we went over the general structure and specific components of PWK. In this Learning Unit, we will summarize each of the Learning Modules included within the course.

### 2.3.1. Getting Started: Optional Ramp-up Modules

We begin with three optional Modules from our Fundamentals series. These Modules are included in PWK for those learners who desire a softer start to their PWK learning journey.

_Introduction to Cybersecurity_ provides a broad survey of the current state of the world of Cybersecurity. It covers how Cybersecurity is practiced as a discipline and what kinds of threats and threat actors exist. It also covers security principles, controls and strategies, Cybersecurity laws, regulations and frameworks, and career opportunities within the industry.

_Effective Learning Strategies_ is a practical introduction to learning theory that explains OffSec's unique approach to teaching. This module begins with an overview of how learning happens and then explores the construction of OffSec materials. The second half of the module is immediately applicable to learners and includes tactics, strategies, and specific, practical steps.

Finally, we continue with a Module on _Report Writing for Penetration Testers_. This Module provides a framework, some advice, and some tips on writing notes as you progress through a penetration test. It also covers how you might think about writing a penetration testing report. The OSCP exam requires each learner to submit a report of their exam penetration test, so it is recommended to practice your notetaking and report-writing skills as you proceed with the Module exercises and Challenge Lab machines.

### 2.3.2. Enumeration and Information Gathering

We then dive into PWK proper, starting with one of the most important aspects of penetration testing: _Information Gathering_. Often called by its synonym _enumeration_, most of one's time during a penetration test is spent on information gathering of one form or another. However, this Module is specifically about how to approach a network at the very outset of an engagement.

We extend our information-gathering toolkit by exploring the concept of [_Vulnerability Scanning_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_scanner). Vulnerability scanning offers us several techniques to narrow our scope within a particular network. It helps us identify machines that are especially likely to be vulnerable. Attack vectors on such machines are often colloquially called _low-hanging fruit_, as the imagery of reaching up to take the easy pieces of fruit off a tree is particularly powerful.

### 2.3.3. Web Application and Client Side Attacks

It is now time to start learning some _perimeter attacks_. By perimeter attacks, we mean methods of infiltration that can be reliably done from the internet. In other words, attacks that can be initiated without any sort of access to an organization's internal network.

We begin with an extensive exploration of Web Application attacks. There are two primary reasons for starting here. The first is that web vulnerabilities are among the most common attack vectors available to us since modern web apps usually allow users to submit data to them. The second is that web applications are inherently visual and therefore provide us with a nice interface for understanding why our attacks work in the way that they do.

_Introduction to Web Applications_ begins by covering a methodology, a toolset, and an enumeration framework related to web applications that will help us throughout the course. It then covers our first vulnerability class: [_Cross-Site Scripting_](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/clarifying-hacking-with-xss/) (XSS). XSS is an excellent vulnerability to start with because it targets the _user_ of a web application as opposed to the server running it. Since the vast majority of our regular day-to-day usage of web applications is as normal users, XSS can be unusually intuitive, compared to other types of attacks.

Because XSS targets users, it can be considered both a Web Application attack and a Client-Side Attack as we'll soon learn.

We continue our exploration of web application attacks in _Common Web Application Attacks_, where we survey four different kinds of vulnerabilities. [_Directory Traversal_](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal) provides us with an example of how we can obtain access to information that we're not supposed to. _File Inclusion_ shows us what can happen when certain configurations are not set up wisely by a web administrator. [_File Upload Vulnerabilities_](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload) demonstrate how we can take advantage of the ability to upload our own files to a web server. Finally, [_Command Injection_](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection) allows us to run code of our choice on the web server itself.

Our examination of web-based attacks concludes with a dedicated Module on [_SQL Injection_](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/start-studying-security-with-sqli/), otherwise known as _SQLi_. This vulnerability class is particularly important not only because of how common it is but because it teaches us how weaknesses can arise in a system due to multiple components interacting with each other in complex ways. In the case of SQLi, a web server and a database need to both be set up in precise ways so that we as attackers cannot abuse them.

_Client-side Attacks_ are another very common external class of attacks. They generally deal with methods of taking advantage of human users of computer systems. In this Module, we'll learn how to perform reconnaissance on a system, attack users of common programs like Microsoft Office, and even how to abuse Microsoft Library Files.

### 2.3.4. Other Perimeter Attacks

It is relatively common to encounter various types of external-facing services on a penetration test that are vulnerable to different kinds of attacks. However, as penetration testers, we will rarely have time to write our own exploits from scratch in the middle of an engagement.

Luckily, there are several ways in which we can benefit from the experience of the information security community. _Locating Public Exploits_ will portray several different means of working with exploits that are available on Kali Linux and [_the internet_](https://www.exploit-db.com/). Then, _Fixing Exploits_ will help us adapt these exploits to suit our specific needs.

We then explore the very surface of a very exciting subject: _Anti-Virus Evasion_. While _Anti-Virus_ (AV) evasion isn't itself a perimeter attack, having some knowledge of how to avoid AV will be helpful since most modern-day enterprises do deploy AV solutions.

Finally, we complete our review of perimeter attacks with an analysis of cryptography and _Password Attacks_. Weak or predictable passwords are extremely common in most organizations. This Module covers how to attack network services and how to obtain and crack various kinds of credentials.

### 2.3.5. Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement

Once we obtain access to a machine, we suddenly have a whole set of new actions and activities open to us. We may want to increase our [_privileges_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation) on the machines so that we can fully control them, or we might want to use this access to gain access to other machines on the network.

_Windows Privilege Escalation_ demonstrates how after compromising a Windows target, we can use our new legitimate permissions to become an Administrator. We will learn how to gather information, exploit various types of services, and attack different Windows components.

_Linux Privilege Escalation_ goes through the same process with Linux targets and obtaining root-level permissions. It reinforces the methodology learned in the previous Module and covers Linux-specific techniques.

Escalating permissions is instrumentally important in an engagement because doing so gives us more access. But as penetration testers, we always want to ask ourselves what the biggest impact our attacks can have on the network and provide the most value for our clients. Sometimes, it can be even more effective to gain access to another machine owned by the organization. When we move from one machine to another on the same network, we call this [_pivoting_](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/pivot#:~:text=Definition(s)%3A,persistent%20threat%20(APT)%20attacks.), and when we move into another subnetwork we call this [_tunneling_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol). _Port Redirection and SSH Tunneling_ cover the basics of persistence skills while _Tunneling through Deep Packet Inspection_ showcases a particular technique that can be used to evade a common network-layer defense.

We wrap up this portion of the course with an exploration of [_The Metasploit Framework_](https://www.metasploit.com/) (MSF). MSF is a powerful set of tools that help us automate many of the enumeration and exploitation steps we've learned so far.

### 2.3.6. Active Directory

[_Active Directory_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview) is one of the most complex and important technologies for us to learn as penetration testers because it is ubiquitous in today's enterprise environment.

PWK dedicates three Modules to this area:

_Active Directory Introduction and Enumeration_ paints a picture of how to think specifically about Windows machines in the context of an Active Directory domain. We will learn how to gather information and set ourselves up to more thoroughly compromise a network.

Then, _Attacking Active Directory Authentication_ provides us with several techniques to increase our presence within the network by attacking or bypassing authentication protocols.

Finally, _Lateral Movement in Active Directory_ helps us understand how to apply many of the pivoting concepts we've previously learned in complex AD environments.

### 2.3.7. Challenge Lab Preparation

The final two PWK Modules represent a bridge between the text, video, and exercise-based learning modalities and the Challenge Labs themselves. By this point, the learner will have completed over 300 exercises, including the compromise of approximately 25 machines. Now it's time to put it all together.

In _Assembling the Pieces_, we walk the learner through a simulated penetration test of five machines. Techniques from _Information Gathering_ through _Lateral Movement in Active Directory_ are required to successfully compromise the domain. Learners will be able to follow along and see exactly how we think about targeting a new environment from start to finish.

Finally, _Trying Harder: The Challenge Labs_ provides a set of instructions and some further detail on the Challenge Labs. We highly recommend completing all the Modules including _Assembling the Pieces_ before beginning with the Challenge Labs!

## 2.4. Wrapping Up

This introduction Module helped orient us to begin with PEN200. We've set up our attacking environment and connected to the PWK labs. We learned a little bit about the pedagogical design of the course and reviewed a summary of each Module. Now it's time to roll up our sleeves and get started!

### Try Harder
At OffSec, we encourage learners to adopt the [_"Try Harder"_](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/what-it-means-to-try-harder/) mindset. To better understand this mindset, let's quickly consider two potential perspectives in a moment of "failure."

1. If my attack or defense fails, it represents a truth about my current skills/processes/configurations/approach as much as it is a truth about the system.
    
2. If my attack or defense fails, this allows me to learn something new, change my approach, and do something differently.
