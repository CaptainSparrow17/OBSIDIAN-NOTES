The discovery of vulnerabilities is an integral part of any security assessment. The process of identifying the attack surface of a piece of software, system, or network is called [_Vulnerability Scanning_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_scanner).

The basic process of an automated vulnerability scanner can be described as:
1. Host discovery
2. Port scanning
3. Operating system, service, and version detection
4. Matching the results to a vulnerability database

[_Host Discovery_](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/292.html) tells the scanner if the target is up and responding. The scanner then uses various techniques to identify all open ports on the system and detect all remotely accessible services with corresponding versions. In addition, operating system detection will be done in this step.
Based on all gathered information, the vulnerability scanner will then query a vulnerability database to match the found data to vulnerabilities. Examples of vulnerability databases are the [_National Vulnerability Database_](https://nvd.nist.gov/) and the [_Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures_](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html) (CVE) program.

Most commercial vulnerability scanners also have the functionality to verify found vulnerabilities by attempting to partially or fully exploit them. This can significantly reduce missed vulnerabilities but can impact the stability of the service or system.
