The discovery of vulnerabilities is an integral part of any security assessment. The process of identifying the attack surface of a piece of software, system, or network is calledÂ [_Vulnerability Scanning_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_scanner).

The basic process of an automated vulnerability scanner can be described as:
1. Host discovery
2. Port scanning
3. Operating system, service, and version detection
4. Matching the results to a vulnerability database
