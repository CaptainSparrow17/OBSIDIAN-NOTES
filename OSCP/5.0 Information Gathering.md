### Open-Source Code
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/)
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/)
##### Github
GitHub’s search, for example, is very flexible.We can use GitHub to search a user’s or organization’s repos.
path:users for file with word users
![](../Attachements/Pasted%20image%2020250104125214.png)
##### This manual approach will work best on small repos. For larger repos, we can use several tools to help automate some of the searching, such as [_Gitrob_](https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob) and [_Gitleaks_](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks).. Most of these tools require an [access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) to use the source code-hosting provider's API.

### Shodan
[_Shodan_](https://www.shodan.io/) is a search engine that crawls devices connected to the internet, including the servers that run websites, but also devices like routers and [IoT](https://www.oracle.com/internet-of-things/what-is-iot/) devices.

To put it another way, Google and other search engines search for web server content, while Shodan searches for internet-connected devices, interacts with them, and displays information about them.

# Active Information Gathering
This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Learn to perform Netcat and Nmap port scanning
- Conduct DNS, SMB, SMTP, and SNMP Enumeration
- Understand Living off the Land techniques
##### We gonna learn port scanning and DNS, SMB, SMTP, and SNMP enumeration.

### DNS Enumeration
The [_Domain Name System_](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) (DNS) is a distributed database responsible for translating user-friendly domain names into IP addresses.
- **NS**: Nameserver records contain the name of the authoritative servers hosting the DNS records for a domain.
- **A**: Also known as a host record, the "_a record_" contains the IPv4 address of a hostname (such as www.megacorpone.com).
- **AAAA**: Also known as a quad A host record, the "_aaaa record_" contains the IPv6 address of a hostname (such as www.megacorpone.com).
- **MX**: Mail Exchange records contain the names of the servers responsible for handling email for the domain. A domain can contain multiple MX records.
- **PTR**: Pointer Records are used in reverse lookup zones and can find the records associated with an IP address.
- **CNAME**: Canonical Name Records are used to create aliases for other host records.
- **TXT**: Text records can contain any arbitrary data and be used for various purposes, such as domain ownership verification.
```bash
host www.megacorpone.com
host -t mx megacorpone.com
```
By default, the host command searches for an A record, but we can also query other fields, such as MX or TXT records, by specifying the record type in our query using the **-t** option.

### TCP/UDP Port Scanning Theory
Please note that port scanning is not representative of traditional user activity and could be considered illegal in some jurisdictions. Therefore, it _should not be performed outside the labs_ without direct, written permission from the target network owner.
```bash
nc -nvv -w 1 -z 192.168.50.152 3388-3390
nc -nv -u -z -w 1 192.168.50.149 120-123
nc -nvv -w 1 -z 192.168.196.151 1-10000 > aaaaaa.txt 2>&1 => to save to a file
```
**-w** option to specify the connection timeout in seconds
**-z** to specify zero-I/O mode
-n                      numeric-only IP addresses, no DNS
-v                      verbose [use twice to be more verbose]
-u                     UDP Scan
![](../Attachements/Pasted%20image%2020250106113654.png)
UDP Scan
![](../Attachements/Pasted%20image%2020250106114611.png)
Most UDP scanners tend to use the standard "ICMP port unreachable" message to infer the status of a target port. However, this method can be completely unreliable when the target port is filtered by a firewall. In fact, in these cases the scanner will report the target port as open because of the absence of the ICMP message.
UDP scanning can be problematic for several reasons. First, UDP scanning is often unreliable, as firewalls and routers may drop ICMP packets. This can lead to false positives and ports showing as open when they are, in fact, closed. Second, many port scanners do not scan all available ports, and usually have a pre-set list of "interesting ports" that are scanned. This means open UDP ports can go unnoticed. Using a protocol-specific UDP port scanner may help to obtain more accurate results. Finally, penetration testers often forget to scan for open UDP ports, instead focusing on the "more exciting" TCP ports. Although UDP scanning can be unreliable, there are plenty of attack vectors lurking behind open UDP ports. A TCP scan also generates much more traffic than a UDP scan, due to overhead and packet retransmissions.


### Port Scanning With Nmap
There are modern port scanners like [_MASSCAN_](https://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/masscan) and [RustScan](https://rustscan.github.io/RustScan/) that, although faster than Nmap, generate a substantial amount of concurrent traffic. Nmap, on the other hand, imposes some traffic rate limiting that results in less bandwidth congestion and more covert behavior.

###### SYN SCAN:: -sS default
If not specified, SYN scan in performed.
SYN scanning is a TCP port scanning method that involves sending SYN packets to various ports on a target machine without completing a TCP handshake. If a TCP port is open, a SYN-ACK should be sent back from the target machine, informing us that the port is open. At this point, the port scanner does not bother to send the final ACK to complete the three-way handshake.
```bash
sudo nmap -sS 192.168.50.149
```
Because the three-way handshake is never completed, the information is not passed to the application layer and as a result, will not appear in any application logs. A SYN scan is also faster and more efficient because fewer packets are sent and received.
Please note that term "stealth" refers to the fact that, in the past, firewalls would fail to log incomplete TCP connections. This is no longer the case with modern firewalls and although the stealth moniker has stuck around, it could be misleading.
###### TCP Connect Scan (`-sT`)
TCP connect scan takes much longer to complete than a SYN scan
```bash
nmap -sT 192.168.50.149
```

###### UDP Scan (`-sU`)
When performing a [UDP scan](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-udp-scan.html), Nmap will use a combination of two different methods to determine if a port is open or closed. For most ports, it will use the standard "ICMP port unreachable" method described earlier by sending an empty packet to a given port. However, for common ports, such as port 161, which is used by SNMP, it will send a protocol-specific SNMP packet in an attempt to get a response from an application bound to that port. To perform a UDP scan, we'll use the **-sU** option, with **sudo** required to access raw sockets.
```bash
sudo nmap -sU 192.168.50.149
```

The UDP scan (**-sU**) can also be used in conjunction with a TCP SYN scan (**-sS**) to build a more complete picture of our target.
```bash
sudo nmap -sU -sS 192.168.50.149
```

![](../Attachements/Pasted%20image%2020250107123124.png)

###### Network Sweep (`-sn`)
```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.50.1-253
```
![](../Attachements/Pasted%20image%2020250107123237.png)

##### Commands to get only live hosts
```bash
nmap -v -sn 192.168.50.1-253 -oG ping-sweep.txt
grep Up ping-sweep.txt | cut -d " " -f 2
```
![](../Attachements/Pasted%20image%2020250107123346.png)

We can also sweep for specific TCP or UDP ports across the network, probing for common services and ports in an attempt to locate systems that may be useful or have known vulnerabilities. This scan tends to be more accurate than a ping sweep.
```bash
nmap -p 80 192.168.50.1-253 -oG web-sweep.txt
grep open web-sweep.txt | cut -d" " -f2
```
![](../Attachements/Pasted%20image%2020250107123533.png)

To save time and network resources, we can also scan multiple IPs, probing for a short list of common ports. For example, let's conduct a _TCP connect scan_ for the top 20 TCP ports with the **--top-ports** option and enable OS version detection, script scanning, and traceroute with **-A**.
```bash
nmap -sT -A --top-ports=20 192.168.50.1-253 -oG top-port-sweep.txt
```

###### OS, we include the **--osscan-guess** option to force Nmap print the guessed result even if is not fully accurate.
```bash
sudo nmap -O 192.168.50.14 --osscan-guess
```
***Note*** that OS Fingerprinting is not always 100% accurate, often due to network devices like firewalls or proxies that rewrite packet headers in between the communication.

###### _Nmap Scripting Engine_ (NSE)
 **/usr/share/nmap/scripts**
```bash
nmap --script-help http-headers
nmap --script http-headers 192.168.50.6
```

#### Port Scan from Windows

[_Test-NetConnection_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/nettcpip/test-netconnection?view=windowsserver2022-ps)
The [_Test-NetConnection_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/nettcpip/test-netconnection?view=windowsserver2022-ps) function checks if an IP responds to ICMP and whether a specified TCP port on the target host is open.
```bash
Test-NetConnection -Port 445 192.168.50.151
```
Powershell one liner to check 1024 ports: This commands is very slow
```powershell
1..1024 | % {echo ((New-Object Net.Sockets.TcpClient).Connect("192.168.50.151", $_)) "TCP port $_ is open"} 2>$null
```

### SMB Enumeration (445)
Its a file share and printers
The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications on a computer to read and write to files and to request services from server programs in a computer network. The SMB protocol can be used on top of its TCP/IP protocol or other network protocols.

The security track record of the [_Server Message Block_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/hh831795(v=ws.11)) (SMB) protocol has been poor for many years due to its complex implementation and open nature. From unauthenticated SMB null sessions in Windows 2000 and XP, to a plethora of SMB [bugs and vulnerabilities](http://markgamache.blogspot.ca/2013/01/ntlm-challenge-response-is-100-broken.html) over the years, SMB has had its fair share of action.

Keeping this in mind, the SMB protocol has also been updated and improved in parallel with Windows releases.

The [NetBIOS](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/NetBIOS) service listens on TCP port 139, as well as several UDP ports. It should be noted that SMB (TCP port 445) and NetBIOS are two separate protocols. NetBIOS is an independent session layer protocol and service that allows computers on a local network to communicate with each other. While modern implementations of SMB can work without NetBIOS, [_NetBIOS over TCP_](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/netbios-over-tcpip) (NBT) is required for backward compatibility and these are often enabled together. This also means the enumeration of these two services often goes hand-in-hand.

```bash
nmap -v -p 139,445 -oG smb.txt 192.168.50.1-254
sudo nbtscan -r 192.168.50.0/24

V3 uses both encryption and authentication

Community string also called #password 'public' is default in some cases..

SNMP is based on UDP, a simple, stateless protocol, and is therefore susceptible to IP spoofing and replay attacks. Additionally, the commonly used SNMP protocols 1, 2, and 2c offer no traffic encryption, meaning that SNMP information and credentials can be easily intercepted over a local network.
Until recently, SNMPv3, which provides authentication and encryption, has been shipped to support only DES-56, proven to be a weak encryption scheme that can be easily brute-forced. A more recent SNMPv3 implementation supports the AES-256 encryption scheme.

#### onesixtyone SNMP scanner
onesixtyone is an SNMP scanner which utilizes a sweep technique to achieve very high performance. It can scan an entire class B network in under 13 minutes. It can be used to discover devices responding to well-known community names or to mount a dictionary attack against one or more SNMP devices.
http://www.phreedom.org/software/onesixtyone/

```bash
Building Textfile containing community Strings
echo public > community
echo private >> community
echo manager >> community

Making List of ips to scan
for ip in $(seq 1 254); do echo 192.168.50.$ip; done > ips

Running onesixtyone commands.
onesixtyone -c community -i ips
```

#### snmpwalk
We can probe and query SNMP values using a tool such as _snmpwalk_, provided we know the SNMP read-only community string, which in most cases is "public".

Using some of the MIB values provided in Table 1, we can attempt to enumerate their corresponding values. Let's try the following example against a known machine in the labs, which has a Windows SNMP port exposed with the community string "public". This command enumerates the entire MIB tree using the `-c` option to specify the community string, and `-v` to specify the SNMP version number, as well as the `-t 10` option to increase the timeout period to 10 seconds:
```bash
snmpwalk -c public -v1 -t 10 192.168.50.151

snmpwalk -c public -v1 -t 10 192.168.234.151 -Oa
-Oa => automatically translate any hexadecimal string into ASCII that was otherwise not decoded.
```



```bash
***Enumurating users on dc01 Machine::***
snmpwalk -c public -v1 192.168.50.151 1.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25

***enumerate all the currently-running processes***
snmpwalk -c public -v1 192.168.50.151 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2

***query all the software that is installed on the machine:***
snmpwalk -c public -v1 192.168.50.151 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.6.3.1.2
We can combine running processes and software installed for cross-checking the exact software version a process is running on the target host.

***list all the current TCP listening ports:***
snmpwalk -c public -v1 192.168.50.151 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.13.1.3

```
