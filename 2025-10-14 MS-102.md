- Learn how to navigate to compliance portal
- My advice is just to study your entra ID and identity management, defender XDR and purview because you will see a lot of questions about sensitivity labels, retention policies , endpoint device enrollment, defender for cloud apps, and a lot of questions about roles and least privilege.
- This is very good ðŸ’¯ Just don't rely on the learn portal for practice questions, the exam questions are way different and difficult from the Microsoft learn practice assessment questions.
- Lots of Defender questions including Cloud Apps so research Mslearn to help you in the exam
- There were many questions about Cloud Apps, Defender for Office/endpoint/cloud apps, and MFA. Of course, there were questions about other topics as well. There was a cross-tenant question. There were 3-4 questions about Administrative Units. I started with the first case study question. It was the first question I encountered when I entered the exam. Good luck on your exam. Be sure to let me know how it goes.
