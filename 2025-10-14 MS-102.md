- Just passed the exam and almost a third were purview questions. Maybe explicitly prepare for those.
- Pureview:: I personally struggled with Purview the most since I barely have any customers who are licensed for the advanced DLP stuff and even if they are, I couldnâ€™t just get in there to look around. I suppose I couldâ€™ve gotten my own demo.
- Learn how to navigate to compliance portal
- My advice is just to study your entra ID and identity management, defender XDR and purview because you will see a lot of questions about sensitivity labels, retention policies , endpoint device enrollment, defender for cloud apps, and a lot of questions about roles and least privilege.
- This is very good ðŸ’¯ Just don't rely on the learn portal for practice questions, the exam questions are way different and difficult from the Microsoft learn practice assessment questions.
- Lots of Defender questions including Cloud Apps so research Mslearn to help you in the exam
- There were many questions about Cloud Apps, Defender for Office/endpoint/cloud apps, and MFA. Of course, there were questions about other topics as well. There was a cross-tenant question. There were 3-4 questions about Administrative Units. I started with the first case study question. It was the first question I encountered when I entered the exam. Good luck on your exam. Be sure to let me know how it goes.
- Im working through it as well.. have started making a notebooklm for each topic and adding the MS learn material into that.. then ask to generate a study guid and audio overview.. the audios are only 30 mins or so but good to listen to whilst doing other stuffasked Gemini to give me a good prompt to use on notebooklm so used this: You are an expert Microsoft 365 Administrator and a seasoned exam preparer for the MS-102 certification.

- If youâ€™re prepping for the MS-102 exam, Scored 920. I highly recommend using Skill-cert-pro practice tests. Theyâ€™re easily the most accurate and closest to the actual exam Iâ€™ve seen. With around 700 questions covering everything from identity and access to compliance and security, you get a solid grip on all the important topics.

When I took the exam last month, about 80% of the questions were very similar to what I had practiced on Skill-cert-pro. That made a huge difference and helped me pass comfortably. Itâ€™s around $20, and totally worth it. They also include a free master sheet for quick revision, which is super handy for reviewing key points right before the exam

- look at the cybervista exams for this one. I found them better than measureup for this exam anywayÂ [Microsoft 365 Administrator (MS-102) | Practice Test - CyberVista now N2K](https://certify.cybervista.net/products/microsoft/microsoft-365-administrator-practice-test/) The exam from cbtnuggets is the exam i linked. That practice test was spot on. I found measureup to be very lacking for this exam.
-  [MD-102 Study Materials | Microsoft Certification Hub](https://certs.msfthub.wiki/microsoft365/md-102/#studying-resources)Â not many options unfortunately
